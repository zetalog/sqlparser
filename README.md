                  Lightweight SQL Parser

The lightweight SQL parser has been deployed in real products, to allow
web users to configure SQLs vi web pages and converts them into backend
commands to query from database.
It only supports a very small subset of SQL grammar, but should be
sufficient for queries used to fetching the web contents.
